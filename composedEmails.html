  <p>Hey Jon,</p>
  <br>
  <p>
    How are you doing? I'm doing well. It's been almost 2 months
    since we last talked. I'm learning to code full-time at Fullstack Academy and enjoying 
    my time. This is an auto-generated email I learned how to make in Fullstack Foundations.

    I've been blogging about my experiences at Fullstack on my blog. 
    Look at my most recent posts:
